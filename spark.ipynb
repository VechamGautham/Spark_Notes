    "# Big Data Problem & How It Was Solved  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days, data processing was handled by COBOL (1959) and later by RDBMS systems like Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL.  \n",
    "These systems were designed for **structured data** stored in rows and columns. They provided SQL for querying, scripting languages (PL/SQL, T-SQL), and programming interfaces (JDBC/ODBC).  \n",
    "For decades, this worked perfectly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But then data began to change.  \n",
    "We started seeing **semi-structured formats** like JSON and XML, and soon **unstructured data** such as PDFs, images, videos, and logs.  \n",
    "Businesses were now collecting **huge amounts of data (terabytes to petabytes)** at **very high speed** from internet, mobile apps, and social media.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This shift created the **Big Data problem**, defined by the 3Vs:  \n",
    "- **Volume** → massive data sizes  \n",
    "- **Velocity** → fast generation and the need for real-time/near real-time processing  \n",
    "- **Variety** → structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RDBMS was not built to handle these challenges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches to Big Data  \n",
    "Two main approaches were considered:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monolithic systems** (e.g., Teradata, Exadata)  \n",
    "  These relied on one huge, powerful machine. They scaled vertically (adding more CPU, RAM, disk to the same box). While powerful, they were costly, hard to scale quickly, and not fault-tolerant—if hardware failed, the whole system went down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed systems**  \n",
    "  Instead of one large machine, this approach used a **cluster of many smaller machines** working together. They scaled horizontally (just add more machines), tolerated hardware failures (other machines kept running), and were far more economical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hadoop: The Solution 🚀  \n",
    "The industry adopted the distributed approach, which led to the creation of **Hadoop**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop acted like an **operating system for a cluster of computers**. It gave three key capabilities:  \n",
    "1. **Cluster Management** – making many machines work as if they were one.  \n",
    "2. **Distributed Storage** – storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across the cluster.  \n",
    "3. **MapReduce Processing** – running programs in parallel across machines for fast data processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, an ecosystem grew around Hadoop:  \n",
    "- **Hive** allowed SQL-style queries.  \n",
    "- **Pig** gave a scripting language.  \n",
    "- **HBase** supported NoSQL storage.  \n",
    "- **Sqoop** handled data import/export.  \n",
    "- **Oozie** managed workflows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## RDBMS vs Hadoop  \n",
    "RDBMS remained strong for **small to medium structured data**, but Hadoop became the go-to platform for **large-scale, diverse, fast-moving data**.  \n",
    "It could scale to petabytes, handle all data types, and process information in parallel, making Big Data manageable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Takeaway  \n",
    "The Big Data problem arose because of the **explosion of data in volume, velocity, and variety**.  \n",
    "RDBMS could not keep up, so the industry moved towards **distributed systems**.  \n",
    "Hadoop emerged as the practical solution—scalable, fault-tolerant, economical, and capable of handling modern data challenges."
